Write a script that takes as argument a wordlist consisting of one word per line and appends all possible combinations of n digits (n provided as second argument) 
to every word in the wordlist, and writes the output in a new wordlist which is the third argument. 
E.g., if the input wordlist contains:
	john
	password
, then for n=4 the output wordlist should contain:
	john0000
	john0001
	...
	john9999
	password0000
	password0001
	...
	password9999
Check arguments and show usage message if wrong arguments.
